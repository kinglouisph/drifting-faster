Made in unity and supposed to be very simple. Didn't want to add a bunch of feature bloat that just wouldn't fit the game.


Created for a school project and to learn unity. Not knowing unity is why there are many questionable programming decisions apparent in the code. For example, to draw the beziers I create a mesh and define the points manually. I have to update the mesh every time the track gets longer, which means changing the vertices and indices manually. Since I also optimized it prematurely, this was a painful thing to impliment and led to many bugs.

I realized the day before it's due I could have just used unity's line renderer and increased the width.
